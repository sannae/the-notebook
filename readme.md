# The notebook
My personal notebook is available at https://sannae.github.io/the-notebook/.

### TO DO:
- [ ] Move all static files to an AWS S3 Bucket, see [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#other-providers) and [here](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-learn-mkdocs/deploy/). There's a nice [workflow] in the GitHub Actions marketplace to take care of it.
