# The Notebook :books:

Welcome to my notes! üëã



## About this documentation

This notebook is a collection of ideas, code snippets, projects, interesting articles, links to blog posts, and anything else catching my attention. Basically it's my [üå± digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

> üìñ _"By relying on an internal database (or ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù) they can reduce their reliance on external search engines. I've found when encountering a similar issue it is often more efficient to reference my own notes as I‚Äôve already written them in a way that makes sense to me rather than to go through the process of parsing through search results until I encounter what I am looking for and then go through the process of translating how it‚Äôs written into a mental model that works for me."_ -- M.Powell, [The ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme/guides/private-documentation).
