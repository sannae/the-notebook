# The Notebook :books:

Welcome to my notes!

## About this documentation

This notebook is a collection of ideas, code snippets, projects, interesting articles, links to blog posts, and anything else catching my attention. Here I gather troubleshooting procedures, notes while learning new languages or technologies, and so on. 

### Workflow behind these docs

This notebook is a static website based on markdown documentation built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

The website configuration (including navigation, custom themes, extensions, plugins, etc.) is available in the [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/sannae/the-notebook/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) file.

Publishing is made on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is handled by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with a [cloud-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners). 

The workflow YAML file is available [here](https://github.com/sannae/the-notebook/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml) and is triggered by any push on the `main` branch.
