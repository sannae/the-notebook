## Working on...

* [:material-github: CRM dockerized web application](https://github.com/sannae/djangocrm): Django, Postgresql, Bootstrap, Docker
* [:material-github: Software support service ticket manager](https://github.com/sannae/hotline): Django, SQLite3, Bootstrap, Docker

## Just ideas for now :bulb:

* `etf-tracker`, an ASP.NET Core web application to track ETFs from multiple trading platforms
* `oci-shape-monitor`, a web client to track the availability of different OCI shapes (inspired by [:material-github: this idea made in PHP](https://github.com/hitrov/oci-arm-host-capacity))
* `lang-progress-tracker`, a WebAPI client interacting with the GitHub API to track the progress of the languages used in GitHub, based on the number of commits 
* Convert `porelli/bash_scripts/Move_containers.sh` in PowerShell and test on Windows Containers
